1. Writing to a csv with and unneccesary index. Remove this with setting index = False.
2. Using column names that include spaces. You should use the underscore inplace of spaces. It makes querying simpler.
3. Not leveraging the query method. df.query('Year' < 1980)
4. Using string methods to formulate your query strings.
   Example: 
	min_year = 1980
	min_time = 10
	df = df.query('Year < @min_year' and Time > @min_time')
5. Using inplace=True. It is better to overwrite using modifications.
6. Not using vectorization insted of iteration.
7. Using the apply method when vectorization is an option.
8. When creating a subset from original data frame and not using the copy() method. When we will update the new dataframe also the old subset of original dataframe will be affected.
9. Not chaining formulas is better than creating many intermediate dataframes.
10. Not properly setting the column dtypes. parse_dates=['Date']
11. Using the string value instead of a boolean.
12. Not levearaging pandas plot method and using matplotlib instead.
13. Using apply, etc... instead of pandas str.upper()
14. Repeating commonly used data transformations, instead you should create a function that will allow you to speed up the process. -> creating a data pipeline.
15. Manually renaming columns -> you should use the rename function.
16. Not using proper way of grouping values.
17. Not using proper way of complex grouping values.
18. Not using percent_change or difference that can be now implemented with a function.
19. Not saving time and space with a large datasets with pickle, parquet, feather formats.
20. Not using conditional format like in Microsoft Excel
21. Not using suffixes while merging TWO dataframes.
22. Not using check merging is success with validation.
23. Not using wrapping expression so they are readable
24. Not using categorical datatypes to use less space.
25. Creating duplicated columns.
