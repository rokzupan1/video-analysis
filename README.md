# video-analysis
Using the data on Kaggle about trending videos in 10 different countires I created a report based on the task that were given to me.
I changed the JSON files into CSV files and in some cases I changed the encoding of the file to UTF-8 with BOOM. Then I uploaded every
dataset into a file TemplateForCountries in which I created a code that give you answers on the first question for Indians and Germans
and for the second question gives you an answer for all 10 countries.
